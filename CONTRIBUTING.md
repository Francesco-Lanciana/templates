## Before you contribute

For all but minor typos, it's a good idea to create an issue detailing the change you wish to make. There we can discuss your proposed changes before creating/submitting a Pull Request (PR).

## How to Contribute

Pull Requests are used to propose changes. The process for creating a PR is as follows:

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a branch with a short yet descriptive name, e.g. create-api-reference
3. Make your changes
4. Make a PR from your branch in your forked project to `master` in the main project. For those new to this process [here is how](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

### Things to note

-   All changes should be formatted according to our configuration. If your PR contains only the changes you made then you are golden.
-   If you have introduced a new template make sure to update the README with the relevant details.
-   Prefix PR's that are purely changes to the wording with **[wording]**
-   Prefix PR's that are specifically for fixing a typo with **[typo]**
-   Please use american spelling, as per the [Merriam-Webster Online](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) dictionary.
-   Reference any related issues in the PR description. If this PR should close an issue when merged than write **_resolves #ISSUE_NUMBER_** (e.g. resolves #123) at the end of the description. This will close the issue automatically upon a merge.
